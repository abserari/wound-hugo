Iâ€™m just another teenager who likes writing, programming and making stuff. I feel the inner urge to contribute something to the Internet because I love writing and I believe posting something online enables users all around the globe to see your work and suggest improvements.

Recently Iâ€™ve also started taking interest in web designing and hosting the fruitful results of which these site and blogs are! Making stuff is just one of the things I love the most.

Curious about me? Use the social links above to contact me, or, with email.

You can also support me on Alipay. Iâ€™d really appreciate it.

Also, This is a blog by Hugo. If you want a Theme or a web site like me, There is a tutorial to help you.


Thatâ€™s all that I can think of right now. Hopefully Iâ€™ll add something more to this later on. ðŸ˜…
